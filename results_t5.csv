andy hello i have had a good look and have done some tests on the mould in your spare bedroom upstairs and in the dinign room betty hello andy thank you for that what are your thoughts andy i think it is caused by condensation as most of the moist settles on and around the windows betty why is that andy those are the coldest areas and therefore where the moist in the warm air turns into water on the windows it is just water on the walls the moist will allow mould to grow betty significant other why is it all over the spare room walls and all around the dining room but not in other rooms andy probably because they have external walls which are cooler than internal walls betty significant other why only that bedroom and not the other ones andy i guess those rooms are most effected as the spare room is next to the bathroom and the dining room next to the kitchen betty but why is not there mould on the kitchen and bathroom itself then andy i think that is because the kitchen does not have external walls and the bathroom has only one external wall and a fan in it the difference when i measured it between internal wall and external wall is about 4 degrees betty does that mean we need new double glazed windows or new wall insulation andy not necessarily that would make a little difference but would still leave you with moist air in the house significant other it would just settle somewhere else betty significant other what would you recommend andy i would install a fan system or piv system which would circulate air to dilute and take some moisture out of the air it would be installed in your loft and be on continuously during day and night betty that sounds good would that be sufficient andy if you buy a decent size it will be but you would also need to treat your walls to get rid of the current mould that will not go away by itself betty ok is this something your company can help with andy it is indeed we can repaint as well if you want betty good point could you please send me a detailed quote for the work via email andy of course i will have that done by friday betty that would be great and again thanks for today andy no problem speak soon,bettys house has mould due to condensation andy will send her a quote for the work needed by friday,andy has done tests on the mould in bettys spare bedroom upstairs and dinign room,"{'rouge1': 0.2941, 'rouge2': 0.0, 'rougeL': 0.1176, 'rougeLsum': 0.1176}"
